# Galia
Split 63-key ergo keyboard with trackball on right-hand side.

## Disclaimer
The layout is based on the [Ergodash](https://github.com/omkbd/ErgoDash) layout with the inner-most keys removed and an improved thumb cluster on the left hand side, and removed thumb cluster for the trackball on the right. The Pro Micro position was also moved inwards to allow for a thinner board. The layout was only used as a reference, nothing was copied and the board is a completely new design.

## Key Features
* Slim design, or as slim as I could get while using standard MX-style Switches. Essentially, the Pro Micro or whatever mounts under the PCB, flush and facing up with the help of a cutout.
* SMK MX-style switch support, solder only but the holes are mill-max socket compatible.
* OLED support, either using a standard 0.91" SSD1306 OLED or the [Crenshaw](https://github.com/Ariamelon/Crenshaw) 1.3" OLED breakout board made by me.
* Trackball support.
* Useable in both wired and wireless modes.
* 18650 LiIon battery support.
